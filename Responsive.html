        Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) was developed in Brazil in the early 20th century by Carlos Gracie and his brothers. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is often considered to be one of the most effective self-defense systems in the world.
            Having been developed in the early 1900s by Japanese immigrant Mitsuyo Maeda, BJJ is often credited as being one of the most effective martial arts, as it emphasizes technical knowledge and grappling styles that can be used to control or submit a resisting opponent without necessarily causing serious injury.
            <p>BJJ is widely practiced as a sport, and competitions are held at both the local and international level. The sport aspect of BJJ focuses on passing an opponent’s guard, achieving a more dominant position, and then applying a submission hold (such as a clock choke or joint lock).
            You can call it “human chess” as it takes tremendous control over the body and the mind.
            Martial artists are awarded points for various positions and techniques, and the goal is to either score enough points to win the match outright, or to force the opponent to submit.

            But enough about BJJ.
            Rather than bore you  with the details of BJJ, i'll rather tell you about my self and how i landed a certificat in front-end web development from WEBBIT TECHNOLOGIES <i>(A famous IT company in the South-South of Nigeria).</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            You see i first came across webbit technologies on instagram where i saw their training for youths in the field of front end web engineering. Immediately paying the fee, i soon joined their online classes and got <strong> IMMENSE</strong> knowledge on everything pertaining to front end web development. Soon afterwards i took several classes online on web design to guarntee customer satisfaction and user experience on my webpages.
            The image you see is the certificate awarded to me October 2022.
